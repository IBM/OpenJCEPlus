# Overview

This project contains source code associated with the `OpenJCEPlus` and `OpenJCEPlusFIPS` cryptographic providers that can be used within a Java SDK. At this time, this project intends to only issue source code releases which will not include any binary distribution format. These cryptographic providers contain capabilities to support JCE cryptographic operations using the `Open Crypto Kit` cryptographic library.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:
Although this project uses the term "FIPS" in different code paths and naming conventions the code and binary files derived from this code CANNOT be
considered FIPS compliant. Achieving certified FIPS cryptography requires the underlying library binary to be FIPS certified for specific platforms
and architectures. Any cryptographic libraries developed must adhere to rigorous FIPS standards and should not be assumed to be available in any environment.
All environments and binaries must undergo the FIPS certification process with NIST to ensure compliance.**

This github branch can only be used with Java version 11.

## How to Build `OpenJCEPlus` and Java Native Interface Library

`OpenJCEPlus` and `OpenJCEPlusFIPS` providers are currently supported on the following architectures and operating system combinations as reported by `mvn --version` in the values `OS name` and `arch`:
| OS name                 | arch        |
| ----------------------- | ----------- |
| linux                   | aarch64     |
| linux                   | amd64       |
| linux                   | s390x       |
| linux                   | ppc64le     |
| Windows Server 2022     | amd64       |
| AIX                     | ppc64       |
| Mac OS X                | aarch64     |
| Mac OS X                | amd64       |

Follow these steps to build the `OpenJCEPlus` and `OpenJCEPlusFIPS` providers along with a dependent Java Native Interface library. Keep in mind that `$PROJECT_HOME` can represent any directory on your system and will be referred to as such in the subsequent instructions. Also keep in mind that the value `$JAVA_VERSION` below must match the same version of the branch of OpenJCEPlus being built. For example if building the `java21` branch the `$JAVA_VERSION` must match the Java 21 SDK version such as `21.0.2+13`.

1. Create an OCK directory, for example:

    ```console
    mkdir $PROJECT_HOME/OCK
    ```

1. Follow instructions available in the project [OpenCryptographyKitC](https://github.com/IBM/OpenCryptographyKitC/) to build both the SDK tar file and the binary distribution tar file. You can also refer to this projects [github-actions.yml](.github/workflows/github-actions.yml) file for details on how this project incorporates and builds the [OpenCryptographyKitC](https://github.com/IBM/OpenCryptographyKitC/) project for testing purposes.

1. Extract the Java gskit SDK tar and gskit tar file into the directory previously created:

    ```console
    cd $PROJECT_HOME/OCK
    tar xvf jgsk_crypto_8_9_3_0_sdk.tar
    tar xvf jgsk_crypto_8_9_3_0.tar
    ```

1. Copy the OCK library referred to as ICC to the correct location:

    Based on the platform, the library file (i.e., `$LIBJGSKIT_LIBRARY`) is named differently. The  values are as follows:
   * AIX/Linux: `libjgsk8iccs_64.so`
   * Mac OS X: `libjgsk8iccs.dylib`
   * Windows: `jgsk8iccs_64.dll`

   Create the `lib64` directory and copy the `$LIBJGSKIT_LIBRARY` library to that location:

   ```console
   mkdir $PROJECT_HOME/OCK/jgsk_sdk/lib64
   cp $PROJECT_HOME/OCK/$LIBJGSKIT_LIBRARY $PROJECT_HOME/OCK/jgsk_sdk/lib64
   ```

   On AIX also copy the library to the `jgsk_sdk` directory **in addition** to the `lib64` directory above.

   ```console
   cp $PROJECT_HOME/OCK/$LIBJGSKIT_LIBRARY $PROJECT_HOME/OCK/jgsk_sdk
   ```

1. Install `Maven` and place the command in your `PATH`. These instructions are OS dependant. It is recommended to make use of version `3.9.2`, although other versions of `Maven` are known to work.
You can test your installation by issuing `mvn --version`. For example:

    ```console
    $ mvn --version
    Apache Maven 3.9.2 (c9616018c7a021c1c39be70fb2843d6f5f9b8a1c)
    Maven home: /tools/apache-maven-3.9.2
    Java version: $JAVA_VERSION, vendor: IBM Corporation, runtime: /opt/ibm/sdks/jdk-$JAVA_VERSION
    Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: ISO8859-1
    OS name: "aix", version: "7.2", arch: "ppc64", family: "unix"
    ```

1. Clone the `OpenJCEPlus` repository.

1. Change directory to the root directory where the `pom.xml` file exists.

    ```console
    cd OpenJCEPlus
    ```

1. Set your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. This will be the SDK used to compile the project. You must set your JAVA_HOME value to Java version 11 when using code located in the `java11` branch.

    ```console
    export JAVA_HOME="/opt/ibm/sdks/jdk-$JAVA_VERSION"
    ```

1. Set the location of the variable `GSKIT_SDK` to the directory extracted in the above steps.

    ```console
    export GSKIT_HOME="$PROJECT_HOME/OCK/jgsk_sdk"
    ```

1. **(Only for Windows)** Some additional environment variables need to be set in Windows. There are certain header files and libraries that are required to build the `OpenJCEPlus` and `OpenJCEPlusFIPS` providers in a Windows environment and those files are found in the exported directories. It is assumed that you are running through a `CYGWIN` prompt.

    ```console
    export PATH=/cygdrive/c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Windows\ Kits/10/bin/10.0.19041.0/x64/:/cygdrive/c/Program\ Files/Microsoft\ Visual\ Studio/2022/Professional/VC/Tools/MSVC/14.31.31103/bin/Hostx64/x64/:$PATH

    export INCLUDE="C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows Kits/10/include/10.0.19041.0/um/;C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows Kits/10/include/10.0.19041.0/shared/;C:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/2022/Professional/VC/Tools/MSVC/14.31.31103/include/;C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows Kits/10/include/10.0.19041.0/ucrt/"

    export LIB="C:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/2022/Professional/VC/Tools/MSVC/14.31.31103/lib/x64;C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows Kits/10/lib/10.0.19041.0/ucrt/x64;C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows Kits/10/lib/10.0.19041.0/um/x64"
    ```

    **NOTE 1**: You need to have installed `Microsoft Visual Studio` and `CYGWIN` on your machine.

    **NOTE 2**: You might have to adapt the exported environment variables, if the installation directory of `Visual Studio` is different on your machine, or the versions you have available for `Windows Kits` and `Visual Studio` are diffent (e.g., the `Windows Kits` version in the variables above is `10.0.19041.0`, but it might be different on your machine).

1. Compile the `OpenJCEPlus` and `OpenJCEPlusFIPS` providers along with the Java Native Interface library. This command intentionally skips test execution. See instructions below for [running tests](#Test-Execution).

    ```console
    mvn '-Dock.library.path=$PROJECT_HOME/OCK/' install -DskipTests
    ```

    On Mac:

    ```console
    mvn '-Dock.library.path=$PROJECT_HOME/OCK/jgsk_crypto' install -DskipTests
    ```

## Test Execution

Tests are available within the `OpenJCEPlus` repository. These Junit tests can be run in various ways including running individual tests or the entire test suite.

### Run all tests

On AIX:

   * You must set an additional setting for the `LIBPATH` environment variable:

   ```console
    export LIBPATH="$PROJECT_HOME/OCK/:$PROJECT_HOME/OCK/jgsk_sdk"
   ```

   * If you are using a JDK that bundles `OpenJCEPlus`, like `Semeru`, and you want to make sure that you use an `OCK` library different than the one bundled with the JDK, you need to delete the bundled one. More specifically you need to run:

   ```console
    rm $JAVA_INSTALL_DIRECTORY/jdk-$JAVA_VERSION/lib/libjgsk8iccs_64.so
    rm -rf $JAVA_INSTALL_DIRECTORY/jdk-$JAVA_VERSION/lib/C
    rm -rf $JAVA_INSTALL_DIRECTORY/jdk-$JAVA_VERSION/lib/N
   ```

On all platforms set the following environment variables and execute all the tests using `mvn`. You must set your JAVA_HOME value to Java version 11 when using code located in the `java11` branch.

```console
export JAVA_HOME="$JAVA_INSTALL_DIRECTORY/jdk-$JAVA_VERSION"
export GSKIT_HOME="$PROJECT_HOME/OCK/jgsk_sdk"
mvn '-Dock.library.path=$PROJECT_HOME/OCK/' test
```

**NOTE**: When using a JDK that doesn't have `OpenJCEPlus` bundled with it, you might notice a few warnings like `WARNING: Unknown module: openjceplus specified to --add-exports`. There is no need to worry as they do not affect execution of tests or the build itself.

### Run single test

On AIX you must set an additional setting for the `LIBPATH` environment variable:

```console
export LIBPATH="$PROJECT_HOME/OCK/:$PROJECT_HOME/OCK/jgsk_sdk"
```

On all platforms change to the OpenJCEPlus directory and set the following environment variables and execute a specific test name using `mvn`. You must set your JAVA_HOME value to Java version 11 when using code located in the `java11` branch.

```console
cd OpenJCEPlus
export JAVA_HOME="$JAVA_INSTALL_DIRECTORY/jdk-$JAVA_VERSION"
export GSKIT_HOME="$PROJECT_HOME/OCK/jgsk_sdk"
mvn '-Dock.library.path=$PROJECT_HOME/OCK/' test -Dtest=TestClassname
```

## OpenJCEPlus and OpenJCEPlusFIPS Provider SDK Installation

1. There are two ways to configure and make use of the OpenJCEPlus and OpenJCEPlusFIPS providers:

    - Approach 1: Modify your `java.security` file located in the `$JAVA_HOME/conf/security` directory by adding one, or both, of the following providers. The value `XX`
below represents your desired preference order. Setting `XX` to 1 would install the provider as the top priority. Be sure to restart your application for the setting to
take effect.

        ```console
        security.provider.XX=com.ibm.crypto.plus.provider.OpenJCEPlus
        ```

        And/Or

        ```console
        security.provider.XX=com.ibm.crypto.plus.provider.OpenJCEPlusFIPS
        ```

    - Approach 2: Programmatic Installation Using `insertProviderAt`
        To register a JCE provider programmatically, use the `java.security.Security.insertProviderAt` method. This method allows you to specify the provider and its preference order directly in your Java code.

        ```java
        import java.security.Security;
        public class ProviderInsert {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                // The value `XX` below represents your desired preference order. Setting this value to
                // position 1 would install the provider as the top priority.
                Security.insertProviderAt(new com.ibm.crypto.plus.provider.OpenJCEPlus(), XX);
            }
        }
        ```

1. A user may optionally choose to install a custom built OpenJCEPlus module built via mvn:

    1. If you're using a Java runtime environment that already includes OpenJCEPlus, such as Semeru, you can optionally pick up
    a newly built module and library:

        ```console
        --patch-module openjceplus="target/classes"
        ```

        ```console
        '-Dock.library.path=$PROJECT_HOME/OCK/'
        ```

        ```console
        -Djgskit.library.path=$ANYDIRECTORY
        ```

    1. If you're using a Java runtime that does not include openjceplus, you must explicitly specify the openjceplus.jar, the location of the OCK library,
    and the jgskit library when running your application. Use the following options:

        ```console
        -Xbootclasspath/a:$ANYDIRECTORY/openjceplus.jar
        ```

        ```console
        '-Dock.library.path=$PROJECT_HOME/OCK/'
        ```

        ```console
        -Djgskit.library.path=$ANYDIRECTORY
        ```

## Algorithm Notes

### ECKeyPairGenerator incorrect keysize

The behaviour for initializing an `ECKeyPairGenerator` with a keysize that is incorrect (i.e., doesn't correspond to the size of one of the expected curves) has changed.

In previous releases, an incorrect keysize would cause a default initialization to `256`.

A `ProviderException` is thrown now if the user attempts to use an `ECKeyPairGenerator` that was initialized with an incorrect keysize.

**NOTE**: One can revert to the previous behaviour using the `-Dopenjceplus.ec.allowIncorrectKeysizes=true` command line argument.

### AESKW
AES Key Wrap based on NIST SP800-38F.

Code does not allow the specification of an IV. However, it will return the default ICV as defined in the NIST SP800-38F.

1. AI generated code is NOT allowed in the main line cryptographic code (i.e. All code in OpenJCEPlus/src/main directory). However, it maybe used for test code.  If GenAI code is used it must be tagged. The begin tag needs to indicate the GenAI tool used to create the code.

   Here are more guidelines:

   - All code that incorporates any output from GenAI tool must be tagged regardless of whether the tag automatically appears in the output or you are manually re-typing GenAI output

   - This applies to all GenAI outputs regardless of the use case.

   - You MUST validate that the use of the GenAI tool does not produce protected code (i.e. code that is copyrighted or licensed outside of our project's current licenses).

    An example of a tagging would be:

    ```console
    /* Start code generated by <GenAI tool> */

    /* End code  generated by <GenAI tool> */
    ```
